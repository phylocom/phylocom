Phylocom
========

`Phylocom` is a command-line application for manipulating ecological
and phylogenetic data, calculating various metrics of phylogenetic and
phenotypic community structure, and measuring trait conservatism and
trait correlations.

The manual is in the `doc/` directory.

Note that the C version of `phylomatic` bundled with `phylocom` is
many years old. It it fast, and still works, but chokes on very large
trees. Please consider using the latest version instead (see:
{[1][1]}, {[2][2]}).
